    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using the Antigravity Attention Engine ("the Application"), you agree to these Terms of Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>The Application is a personal content creation assistant that helps users draft and publish content to X
        (formerly Twitter). It is intended for personal, non-commercial use by the account owner.</p>

        <li>You must not use the Application for spam, harassment, or any illegal activity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. API Usage</h2>
    <p>The Application uses X's API within the rate limits of the Free Tier (500 posts/month, 100 reads/month). The
        Application does not automate follows, likes, or retweets.</p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer</h2>
